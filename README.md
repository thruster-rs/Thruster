# Thruster
## An opinionated framework for web development in rust.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trezm/Thruster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trezm/Thruster)

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/thruster/0.4.5/thruster/)

Thruster is a web framework that aims for developers to be productive and consistent across projects and teams. Its goals are to be:
- Opinionated
- Fast
- Intuitive

Thruster also
- Does not use `unsafe`
- Works in stable rust

## Opinionated

thruster and thruster-cli strive to give a good way to do domain driven design. It's also designed to set you on the right path, but not obfuscate certain hard parts behind libraries. Made with science 🔭, not magic 🧙‍♂️.

## Fast

Using the following wrk command, here are the results in `hello_world` examples for various frameworks

```bash
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:4321/plaintext
```

## Intuitive

Based on frameworks like Koa, and Express, thruster aims to be a pleasure to develop with.

## Getting Started

### The most basic example

```rust
extern crate thruster;
extern crate futures;

use std::boxed::Box;
use futures::future;

use thruster::{App, BasicContext as Ctx, MiddlewareChain, MiddlewareReturnValue};

fn plaintext(mut context: Ctx, _chain: &MiddlewareChain<Ctx>) -> MiddlewareReturnValue<Ctx> {
  let val = "Hello, World!".to_owned();
  context.body = val;

  Box::new(future::ok(context))
}

fn main() {
  println!("Starting server...");

  let mut app = App::<Ctx>::new();

  app.get("/plaintext", vec![plaintext]);

  App::start(app, "0.0.0.0", 4321);
}
```

### Quick setup without a DB

The easiest way to get started is to just clone the [starter kit](https://github.com/trezm/thruster-starter-kit)

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:trezm/thruster-starter-kit.git
> cd thruster-starter-kit
> cargo run
```

The example provides a simple plaintext route, a route with JSON serialization, and the preferred way to organize sub routes using sub apps.

### Quick setup with postgres

The easiest way to get started with postgres is to install thruster-cli,

```bash
> cargo install thruster-cli
```

And then to run

```bash
> thruster-cli init MyAwesomeProject
> thruster-cli component Users
> thruster-cli migrate
```

Which will generate everything you need to get started! Note that this requires a running postgres connection and assumes the following connection string is valid:

```
postgres://postgres@localhost/<Your Project Name>
```

This is all configurable and none of it is hidden from the developer. It's like seeing the magic trick and learning how it's done! Check out the docs for [thruster-cli here](https://github.com/trezm/thruster-cli).
