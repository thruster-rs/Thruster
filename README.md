# Fanta
## An opinionated framework for web development in rust.

Fanta is a web framework that aims for developers to be productive and consistent across projects and teams. Its goals are to be:
- Opinionated
- Fast
- Intuitive

Its goals are not to be:
- Flexible
- A reinvention of the web framework as we know it

Based heavily off of the work here: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-minihttp

## WARNING -- FANTA IS NOT READY, AND PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON GITHUB YET

## TODO
- [ ] Parameters in routes
- [ ] Make routes macros
- [ ] Allow macro routes to have middleware
